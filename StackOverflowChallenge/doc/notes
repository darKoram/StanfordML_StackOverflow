$locate panda

/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/pandas/io/parsers.pyc

On hover over pd gives
Found at: pandas.__init__
C extensions not built: if you installed already

and in pandas
try:
    import pandas._tseries as lib
except Exception, e:  # pragma: no cover
    if 'No module named' in str(e):
        raise ImportError('C extensions not built: if you installed already '
                          'verify that you are not importing from the source '
                          'directory')
                          
                          
So my guess is we are importing from source rather than from lib
/usr/share  instead of 
/usr/lib

How to tell eclipse no look for panda in /usr/lib?

Eclipse is grabbing pandas file from /usr/share/pyshared

def main():
    header, sample = sample_train(os.path.join(cu.data_path, "train.csv"))
    cu.write_sample("train-sample1.csv", header, sample)

    header, sample = sample_train(os.path.join(cu.data_path, "train-A.csv"))
    save_sample("train-A-sample1.csv", header, sample)
    
 save_sample is not defined in sample_train.py.
 features.py has a line: import features.  Is that allowed?
 There is also a file called features (no .py) in the data download.

  I want to replicate the Tsay's iterative outlier detection procedure and 
  Chen and Liu's joint outlier detection procedure in time series. 
  Could any body help me in writing the code?

  You will need to redefine the path on your system to where you have downloaded your files
  in competition_utilities.py

  ToolChain:
  git for version control and downloading start files
  linux(ubuntu)
  Python IDE = Eclipse with PyDev
  ipython with numpy, scipy
  libreoffice to inspect the csv files
  
  I work with an ipython terminal, Eclipse and Ipython notebook (in firefox) open 
  all at the same time.  The terminal is best for testing syntax quickly.  PyDev gives
  nice code completion and tooltips (notepad does to with tab) and the notepad provides
  a nice way of recording an interactive session and presenting work to others.  Also,
  it's not too uncommon for something to not work in one dev environment but to work
  in another!
  
  Make sure if you edit coolstuff.py in Eclipse that you reload(coolstuff) in iPython
  notebook and the terminal.
